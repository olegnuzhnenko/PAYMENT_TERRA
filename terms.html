          accounting records.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.2. <strong>PAYMENTERRA</strong> has the right and the <strong>Customer</strong> agrees that it may at any
          time:
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          (ii) Change all or part of the services it offers to the <strong>Customer</strong> under the Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.3. The <strong>Customer</strong> can choose to terminate the Agreement at
          any time by notifying <strong>PAYMENTERRA</strong> in the manner stipulated
          in the Termination Paragraph of this Agreement, if it objects to the
          amendments in the terms and conditions and/or the changes in the services
          provided by <strong>PAYMENTERRA</strong>. The <strong>Customer</strong>
          agrees that upon termination of the Agreement and paid fees will not be
          refunded and <strong>PAYMENTERRA</strong> agrees that no additional fees
          will be charged. For clarification purposes, any fees that are still due to <strong>PAYMENTERRA</strong> and
          owed by the <strong>Customer</strong> will
          remain due and the <strong>Customer</strong> should settle them even if the
          Agreement has been terminated.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.4. Continued use of the services by the <strong>Customer</strong> will be

          or change in Services, <strong>Customer</strong> agrees to abide by and be

          ’s Transactions over the internet. The security measures taken consist of
          encryption and firewall systems as well as publicly known intrusion
          prevention mechanisms. For encryption <strong>PAYMENTERRA</strong> will use
          Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology which is considered the standard,
          while for the firewall system it will use a combination of hardware and
          software that will result in all external traffic terminating at a
          demilitarized firewalled zone.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.6. <strong>PAYMENTERRA</strong> does not guarantee the security of the
          Services or Transaction data and will not be responsible in the event of
          any infiltration of its security systems, provided that <strong>PAYMENTERRA</strong> has used commercially
          reasonable efforts to
          prevent any such infiltration. <strong>Customer</strong> further
          acknowledges and agrees that it, and not <strong>PAYMENTERRA</strong>, is
          responsible for the security of Transaction data, or information or any
          other information stored on <strong>Customer</strong>’s servers, and that <strong>PAYMENTERRA</strong> is not
          responsible for any other party’s
          servers (other than subcontractors of <strong>PAYMENTERRA</strong> solely

        </p>
        <p>
          16.6.2. If an <strong>Customer</strong> Account has been switched to the
          “Closed” mode in the system due to a mistake, meaning without any <strong>Customer</strong> instruction and
          out of any applicable internal
          regulation/terms and conditions, the account may be freely reactivated. In
          such case, the <strong>Customer</strong> Account relation is reputed to
          have been uninterrupted.
        </p>
        <p>
          16.6.3. In case the <strong>Customer</strong> states that the <strong>Customer</strong> Account closure
          instruction was given by mistake
          (for instance by misfiling a withdrawal form), the <strong>PAYMENTERRA</strong> shall assess, based on the
          circumstances and
          explanations given by the <strong>Customer</strong>, whether it can
          reasonably be considered that the <strong>Customer</strong> instruction was
          mistaken and that the <strong>Customer</strong> did not want to close the<strong>Customer</strong> Account. In
          case the conclusion is that the<strong>Customer</strong>’s closure instruction was erroneous, the
          <strong>Customer</strong> Account relation shall be maintained
          open/reactivated and is reputed to have been uninterrupted.
